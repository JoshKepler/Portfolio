# (Work-In-Progress) NFL-Projections
Hello my name is Josh and I am passionate about data analysis and painting pictures with data. I am attempting to gain my Data Scientist with Python Certification from Data Camp. To demonstrate these skills I have learned from this certification I wanted to make a GitHub to showcase my skills. I am always looking for new oppurtunities and building my network. If you would like to connect please contact me on linkedIn

Fantasy Football is a great game to play for people who love stats like myself. Fantasy Football is a game played week over week in cadence with the NFL (National Football League) schedule. You will draft players at the beginning of the season to create your Fantasy Team to play against other Fantasy Teams. I will be going over the basics of fantasy football throughout the documentation and analysis.

I will assume the reader has a basic undertanding of American Football, if the reader is not familiar with American Football, please watch this short video created by the NFL, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t6hM5tRlfA&ab_channel=NFLUK. 

With the popularity of Fantasy Football Expanding, we can use data to gain an edge in our leagues. I will be using standard fantasy football league setting in my scenarios unless otherwise noted:

-	The goal for each week is to score more points from your starter's then your opponent's starters. Which ever team scores more points by the end of the week earns a win
-	Leagues typically have 10-12 team, we will be assuming 12 teams in these scenarios unless specified
-	9 starters (1 Quarterback, 2 Running Backs, 2 Wide Receivers, 1 Tight End, a Flex (RB,WR or TE), Kicker and Defense) with 6 Bench spots.
-	Standard Scoring: 
  -	Passing: 1 point per 25 yards, 4 points per passing touchdown, -2 points per passing interception
  -	Rushing: 1 point per 10 yards, 6 points per rushing touchdown, -2 points for fumbling
  -	Receiving: 1 point per 10 yards, 6 points per receiving touchdown, additional points can be earned per reception/catch
  -	2-Point Conversion: 2 points for passing, rushing or receiving 2-point conversion
-	Points Per Reception (PPR): this rule varies across leagues with 0, .5 & 1 point, we will be assuming .5 PPR in these scenarios unless specified.

The skills I will be demonstrating will be:
-	Python
-	Data Analysis with Visualizations, Sampling & Hypothesis Testing
-	Various Modules: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-	Importing, Cleaning & Manipulating Data
-	Leveraging APIs

I will be demonstrating my skills in python to show the advantages we can gain from leveraging data in fantasy football topics will include:
- Value over replacement players
- Do specific positions correlate to other positions
- Point scaricty among different positions
- Creating projections for players
