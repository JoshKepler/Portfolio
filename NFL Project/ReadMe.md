Fantasy Football is a great game to play for people who love stats like myself. Fantasy Football is a game played week over week in cadence with the NFL (National Football League) schedule. You will draft players at the beginning of the season to create your Fantasy Team to play against other Fantasy Teams. I will be going over the basics of fantasy football throughout the documentation and analysis.

I will assume the reader has a basic undertanding of American Football, if the reader is not familiar with American Football, please watch this short video created by the NFL, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t6hM5tRlfA&ab_channel=NFLUK. 

The skills I will be demonstrating will be:
-	Python
-	Data Analysis with Visualizations, Sampling & Hypothesis Testing
-	Various Modules: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-	Importing, Cleaning & Manipulating Data
-	Leveraging APIs
-	Machine Learning & AI

I will be demonstrating my skills in python to show the advantages we can gain from leveraging data in fantasy football topics will include:
- Creating Projections for players (Completed! Please see the combined projections code for all offensive players this upcoming season. You can also view the Rookie, Sophmore, Junior, 4+ seasons predictions by visiting the Player Projections by Experience folder)
- Value over replacement players (Completed!)
- Do specific positions correlate to other positions (Not Started)
- Point scaricty among different positions (Not Started)
